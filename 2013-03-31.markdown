% `snap`: An Online SBML Model Designer
% Stanley Gu; Herbert Sauro

# Introduction

Mathematical models of biological networks (bio-models) are important
biomedical research tools. The design, development, and curation of these
models may involve collaborations between many scientists within a research
team or amongst the bio-modeling community at large. However, no current tool
provides the means to build, share, and publish interactive models on the web.

To meet this need, [`snap`](http://stanley-gu.github.com/snap/) is an SBML
model viewer, editor, and simulator that is written in JavaScript and can run
entirely within a web browser.

## Components

### Browser

-	**JavaScript libraries.** The application logic uses and builds upon a
	number of open-source and actively developed libraries to produce a rich
	graphical user interface to load, manipulate, and simulate bio-models.
	Using software libraries is encouraged because it reduces the amount of
	custom code needed to be written and embraces best practices set by the
	development industry and community.

	-	[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) provides a Model-View-Controller
		(MVC) framework for handling the application logic.
	-	[Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) is module loader that helps
		organize re-usable JavaScript components and increases loading and
		latency times for clients.
	-	[D3.js](http://d3js.org/) is a flexible library used to manipulate the
		browser document object model (DOM) to visualize data. This is used for
		drawing visual diagram representations of the bio-models and plotting
		simulation results.
	-	[Ace](http://ace.ajax.org/) is an in-browser editor which will allow
		users to input, edit, and export code in a variety of different formats
		(*e.g.* SBML, MATLAB, etc.).

### Server
-	**`Node.js` server.** In order to use perform heavy server-side
	computation and use non-JavaScript libraries, `snap` uses a
	`node.js` backend. While a more traditional server technology could
	have been used, such as `Apache`, `node.js` was selected because its
	single-process, asynchronous-execution capabilities would allow for
	rapid communications between server and client that is necessary for
	interactive simulations. Furthermore, since `node.js` is implemented
	entirely in JavaScript, both the front-end and back-end, program
	logic can be reused on either end, and code maintenance and
	development is all in a single language.

-	**Libraries**. A number of popular software libraries for systems biology
	written in languages other than Javascript (such as C/C++) will be used on
	the server 
	-	[libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) is popular library for
		reading and writing SBML files.
	-	[RoadRunner](https://code.google.com/p/roadrunnerlib/) is a powerful
		simulation engine for simulating the models viewed through the browser
		front-end.
	-	[GraphFab](https://code.google.com/p/graphfab/) will be used to perform
		the automated layout of the model.

### Development Tools
-	**Source Control with `git`.** `Git` is used as a source control system in
	developing `snap`. Furthermore, `git` is planned to be used as the back-end
	for versioning and tracking model development.

## Advantages of a Bio-Model Designer Web Application

-	**A no-install and always-updated, modeling platform.** The end user
	will never have to install any software

-	**Quickly view and interact with published models.** Mathematical
	models in scientific publications are often difficult to reproduce
	exactly, even if the underlying SBML is included with the
	publication. `snap` will allow a publication to directly link to a
	live and interactive version of their model.

-	**Always have models available on any computer.** Models can be
	stored and edited online, with version control of the model
	development done through `git`.

-	**Collaborate with other modelers.** Multiple users can work on
	building the same model and sharing experimental data.
